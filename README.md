# UX RECIPE

## What's new 

**Current version: 0.1.2**

+ You can now save the calculation in
.png format using html2canvas.

+ Added new "supporters" section - all major blogs, websites or newsletter that shared UX Recipe.

**Version: 0.1.1**

+ Added a "Clear values" buttons - it will reset the inputs you typed.


**Version 0.1.0**

+ The Estimation Calculator has been changed based on the feed I received. Now you add your
numbers of hours. The subtotal is calculated automatically. 

+ I also merged pull requests (from contributors) and fixed other bugs.

**Version: 0.0.3**

+ Now when you print it only selects the calculations and **not** the entire page (I used @media print queries). Much more useful when budget decisions are needed to be made.  

**Version: 0.0.2**

+ I added a popover for the hashtag, incentivizing users to discover more resources. It opens after 10 seconds delays (last 5 seconds) after the page loads, but can be opened manually at any time.
+ Now you can reset your selections. The checkboxes return 
+ Small text modifications


## About the project

This project is a personal manifesto against **the objectification of the term "UX"**. It's more than UI, it's more than a PSD file.

You can use the project in **three ways**:

+ select the ux tools and techniques for your next project;
+ estimate (people, days, costs) for each and calculate the total;
+ click on the #hashtags to discover recommendations & templates for each (if you have suggestions, with no restrains, do contact me to update the list);


## Inspiration

I created this based on my experience and inspiration such as:
[Project Guide to UX Design](http://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321815386/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1421790551&sr=1-1&keywords=A+Project+Guide+to+UX+Design), [Smashing UX Design](http://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Design-Foundations-Designing-Experiences/dp/0470666854/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1421790589&sr=1-1&keywords=smashing+ux+design), [A Designer's Research Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Designers-Research-Manual-Succeed-Knowing/dp/1592535577/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1421790645&sr=1-1&keywords=designer+research)

## Tools used
For coding this project I used the following:
[Bootstrap 3.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Labelauty](http://fntneves.github.io/jquery-labelauty/), [Sweet Alert 2](https://limonte.github.io/sweetalert2/), [Fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

PS: this project is not intended to be a coding masterpiece. I have still a lot of work to do under the hood: refinements, optimizations, reorganization etc. It's a prototype, but I will continue working and making it better (I'm fully aware the Javascript is a mess).


## Contribute
Feel free to contribute to the project in any way possible. For any feedback (like corrections, suggestions, new structure or features etc.) you can use my blog's contact form.
I can't wait to see how we can improve it together. Feel free to fork. The code I written is licensed under MIT Licence and let's keep it that way (it's only fair as it relies on projects under the same or are free to use: e.g. Bootstrap, Fontawesome, Labelauty, Sweet Alert 2).
